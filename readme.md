# Pre-work - Simple To-do

Simple To-do is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: Raymond Chow

Time spent: Maybe 5-10 hours spent in total. Sorry, not quite sure the exact amount of time since I didn't realize we were keeping tabs on time.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

## Notes

The above features were to satisfy the initial requirements as instructed. I intend to implement the other optional features and hopefully more after this first submission. As for initial thoughts during this whole process, I do find the Android SDK to be rather convoluted. 
This probably could be attributed to my lack of experience with it though.
